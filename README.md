# Overview

For this project, the goal was to learn how to use React and get a bit of a feel for what it can do. The project was a simple Todo list with a few different functions inside. You have a basic input bar that can allow the user to add new tasks to their list. Each item has a checkbox next to them so the user can change them off. You have a clear all completed button, which removes any task that has been checked off. There is also a clear-all button that will simply wipe the whole list. The list does actually save, so if you refresh it, the list is still there. I added some CSS to help make the website look a bit more pleasant than just a white screen with some text on it.

# Web Pages

The web app only has a single page but changes around when the user adds or removes elements from the list. The page can continue to grow as the user inputs more tasks. 

# Development Environment

The IDE I used for this project was visual studio code. It helps streamline the process a bit with helpful add-ons as well as the GitHub functionally allowing for uploading to git to be very simple and quick.

The largest part of the project was written in Javascript with the React Library. Since it was also a website, a little bit of HTML and CSS were included. 

# Useful Websites

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_react.asp)

# Future Work

* Cloud storage so it does not have to be saved on the userâ€™s computer
* Improve the looks
* Allow users to input images with a task
